# Spotify-Data-Analysis-Project
Spotify Data Analysis Using Python
## Project Overview:
This project analyzes a dataset of Spotify tracks to uncover factors affecting song popularity. The dataset includes details like song duration, energy, loudness, and artist information. Initial steps involved data cleaning, identifying and handling null values, and converting track duration into seconds for easier analysis. The primary goal was to determine which attributes most influence popularity. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) included sorting songs by popularity, examining summary statistics, and visualizing relationships between features. A correlation heatmap was generated to examine how numerical features interact, especially focusing on attributes like energy and loudness. Additionally, tracks with high popularity scores were isolated to understand the specific traits they share.

## Final Conclusion:
The analysis showed significant insights into the features associated with popular songs. Notably, attributes such as energy, danceability, and loudness exhibited a positive correlation with popularity. The duration of tracks also varied but did not strongly impact popularity. The loudness vs. energy analysis demonstrated a close relationship, suggesting that high-energy tracks tend to have greater loudness, likely contributing to listener engagement. This project provides a foundation for understanding the key characteristics that define successful tracks on Spotify. Future research could include genre-based analysis or predictive modeling to determine popularity potential for new releases. The findings here can aid music producers and marketers in designing music that aligns with listener preferences, maximizing reach and engagement on streaming platforms.
